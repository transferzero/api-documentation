## USD::Bank

For USD bank payments in Egypt please use:

{% capture data-raw %}
```javascript
 "details": {
  {{ recipient_name }},
  "street": "1 Main Street",
  "phone_number": "+201023456789", // optional
  "iban": "EG380019000500000000263180002",
  "transfer_reason": "personal_account",
  "country": "EG"
}
```
{% endcapture %}

{% include language-tabbar.html prefix=usd-bank-egypt-details  raw=data-raw %}

{% if include.recipient_type == 'individual' %}
Although the `middle_name` field is optional, having the full name (first, middle and last name as stated on the government issued ID) of the beneficiary is a regulatory requirement and will ensure faster settlement due to less regulatory screening time.

{% if include.recipient_type == 'individual' %}
  **For Individual Senders:**
  {% capture data-raw %}
  ```javascript
