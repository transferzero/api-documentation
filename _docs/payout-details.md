**Note** Occasionally there might be issues with one of the corridors and we might have to disable them temporarily. Once youre onboarded we'll let you know if this happens. Also if you're trying to use a disabled corridor you're going to receive a validation error stating that the corridor is not active, and you won't be able to create new transactions there.

# Morocco

## MAD::Cash

For Cashplus cash pickup requests please use:

{% capture data-raw %}
```javascript
"details": {
  "first_name": "First",
  "last_name": "Last",
  "phone_number": "212537718685"
    // Mandatory; International format preferred
  "reason" => "Remittance payment",
    // Optional; Default value is 'Remittance payment'
  "identity_card_type" => "NI",
    // Refers to the recipient's ID details; Optional; Values: "PP": Passport, "NI": National ID
  "identity_card_id" => 'AB12345678'
    // Refers to the recipient's ID details; Optional
}
```
{% endcapture %}

{% include language-tabbar.html prefix="mad-cash-details" raw=data-raw %}

Due to regulatory reasons all senders trying to create `MAD::Cash` transactions need to have the following details present:
- `"identification_type" => "OT"` - Values: `"OT"`: Other, `"PP"`: Passport, `"ID"`: National ID
- `"identification_number" => "AB12345678"`
- `"gender" => "M"` - Values: `"M"`: Male, `"F"`: Female

Please note that the fields above are generally considered optional for senders for other payment corridors. If you wish to use an existing sender who has some of these fields missing you can provide them alongside the `id` or `external_id` field in the sender details. For example:

{% capture data-raw %}
```javascript
{
  "transaction": {
      "sender": {
        "external_id": "<id of sender>",
        "gender": "M",
        (...)
      },
      (...)
    }
}
```
{% endcapture %}

{% include language-tabbar.html prefix="mad-cash-sender-details" raw=data-raw %}

Please note when sending `MAD::Cash` payments you should subscribe to the `recipient.pending` webhook, as that will broadcast the payment reference ID the customer need to use to obtain the funds. Example webhook response excerpt:

{% capture data-raw %}
```javascript
{
   (...)
   "state":"pending",
   "metadata": {
     "payment_reference":"9M5GJRJUBCY"
   },
   (...)
}
```
{% endcapture %}

{% include language-tabbar.html prefix="mad-cash-pending" raw=data-raw %}

The payment reference can also be provided in the recipient details hash optionally for `MAD::Cash` in which case it will be used instead of the one we generate. The field you have to provide in the hash is called `reference`. If you wish to use this functionality, please contact us for more details.
