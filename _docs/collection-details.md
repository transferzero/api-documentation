# NGN card collection requests through Interswitch

To initiate an NGN card collection through Interswitch please use the following details:

{% capture data-raw %}
```javascript
"input_currency": "NGN",
"payin_methods": [
  {
    "type": "NGN::Bank",
    "in_details": {
      "redirect_url": "http://redirect.back.to"
    },
    "provider": "interswitch"
  }
],
```
{% endcapture %}

{% include language-tabbar.html prefix="collection-ngn-card" raw=data-raw %}

Please note the `redirect_url` which has to be set to an URL where you wish the user to be redirected once the payment has either been done, or the request has been rejected by the user.

Once the transaction has been created the `out_details` will be:

{% capture data-raw %}
```javascript
"out_details": {
  "style": "redirect",
  "url": "https://api.transferzero.com/payin/interswitch/xxxxxxxx/yyyyyyyy"
}
```
{% endcapture %}

{% include language-tabbar.html prefix="collection-ngn-card-out" raw=data-raw %}

In this case the user needs to be redirected to the url described at `url`.

Once they are redireted there they need to fill out their card details on the following pages.

![Interswitch transaction page 1]({{ "/img/collections/isw_card_page_1.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

The first page will be pre-filled with the sender's email address which can be updated, and the `payin_reference` number, which however should not be changed by the user!

Once the details are filled out the user will be redirected to the card payment pages:

![Interswitch transaction page 2]({{ "/img/collections/isw_card_page_2.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

Please note that here the amount also includes the 100 NGN card transaction fee as well. Dependent on the card the user might be required to enter their PIN number as well:

![Interswitch transaction page 2b]({{ "/img/collections/isw_card_page_2b.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

Once the details are filled out dependent on the card, the user might also be required to fill out a second factor verification site:

![Interswitch transaction page 3]({{ "/img/collections/isw_card_page_3.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

Once the details have been entered the user will be redirected back to the `redirect_url` URL that was set up in the request. If the transaction was successful we will send a `transaction.paid_in` webhook as well.

# NGN card, bank or mobile collection requests through Paga

Paga supports collections through their own mobile wallet system. They also support collections through some banks and some debit cards in Nigeria. Regardless of collection method the user has to be registered with Paga on <https://www.mypaga.com> in order to use the system.

To initiate an NGN collection through Paga please use the following details:

{% capture data-raw %}
```javascript
"input_currency": "NGN",
"payin_methods": [
  {
    "type": "NGN::Mobile",
    "provider": "paga"
  }
],
```
{% endcapture %}

{% include language-tabbar.html prefix="collection-paga-in" raw=data-raw %}

The `out_details` will be:

{% capture data-raw %}
```javascript
"out_details":{
  "style": "info",
  "url": "https://www.mypaga.com/paga-web/customer/login",
  "Merchant": "BitPesa",
  "Reference": "187464"
}
```
{% endcapture %}

{% include language-tabbar.html prefix="collection-paga-out" raw=data-raw %}

Once the transaction is initated the user should either login to their Paga account on the website, or alternatively use the Paga mobile app. They have to send the specific amount of funds to the merchant (usually "BitPesa") and reference number (usually a 6 digit number) provided in the response.

Once the payment has been successfully done a `transaction.paid_in` webhook will be sent out.

The Paga payment process looks like the following on the website: (Paying through the mobile app has similar steps as well)

![Paga login page 1]({{ "/img/collections/paga_mobile_login_1.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

First the user has to log in if they are not already.

![Paga login page 2]({{ "/img/collections/paga_mobile_login_2.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

Once logged in they should select the "pay bill or merchant" option

![Paga login page 3]({{ "/img/collections/paga_mobile_login_3.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

Once selected, they should scroll to the bottom and search for the Merchant returned in the response above. This is usuall called "BitPesa".

![Paga transaction page 1]({{ "/img/collections/paga_mobile_page_1.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

Next the user has to enter the exact amount and reference number in the next page. These fields will not be pre-filled, so it's important that they are filled out by the customer properly otherwise the payments could not be linked to the transaction appropariately.

Once the details have been filled out there's a confirmation page:

![Paga transaction page 2]({{ "/img/collections/paga_mobile_page_2.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

Note that on the confirmation page there's an extra fee added to the amount. The customer should double check that the reference number and the amount (without the extra fee) matches the transaction details, otherwise the payment will not be linked properly.

Once the Pay button is pressed the user can choose how to pay the transaction. They can either use their Paga mobile wallet:

![Paga transaction page 3a]({{ "/img/collections/paga_mobile_page_3a.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

Or select bank collection (note that not all banks are supported by Paga for collection):

![Paga transaction page 3b]({{ "/img/collections/paga_mobile_page_3b.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

Or card payments (note that not all debit cards are supported by Paga for collection):

![Paga transaction page 3c]({{ "/img/collections/paga_mobile_page_3c.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

Finally once the payment goes through the customer will see a success page:

![Paga transaction page 4]({{ "/img/collections/paga_mobile_page_4.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

To initiate an NGN bank or card collections through Providus, use the following details:

{% capture data-raw %}
```javascript
"input_currency": "NGN",
"payin_methods": [

      "payment_method": "bank",
      "redirect_url": "http://redirect.back.to"
    },
    "provider": "providus"
  }
],
```
{% endcapture %}

{% include language-tabbar.html prefix="collection-ngn-card-bank" raw=data-raw %}

Please note both `redirect_url` and `payment_method` are **optional** and:
- The `redirect_url` is the URL where you wish the user to be redirected once the payment has either been done, or the request has been rejected by the user.
- The `payment_method` options are `bank` or `card`. Leaving this empty or omitting entirely will default to support both methods.

Once the transaction has been created the `out_details` will be:

{% capture data-raw %}
```javascript
"out_details": {
  "Bank Name": "Providus Bank",
  "Account Number": "yyyyyyyy",
  "url": "https://sdk.monnify.com/checkout/xxxxxxxx"
}
```
{% endcapture %}

{% include language-tabbar.html prefix="collection-ngn-card-bank-out" raw=data-raw %}

Depending on the payment method:
- If `bank` payment method, the user won't need to be redirected as the needed details, `Bank Name` and `Account Number`, should be enough to enable the user to deposit funds into the account.
- If `card` payment method, the user needs to be redirected to the url described at `url`.

Once they are redirected, they will land on the first page where they shall choose which payment method to use.

![Providus choose payment method]({{ "/img/collections/providus_choose_method.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

If **Pay with Bank Transfer** method is chosen,

![Providus bank payment]({{ "/img/collections/providus_bank.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

This page contains information about the amount and bank account the user should deposit the amount into.

If **Pay with Card** method is chosen,

![Providus card payment]({{ "/img/collections/providus_card.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

This page contains information about the amount. The user should fill in their card details.

Once the card details are filled out, dependent on the card, the user might also be redirected to fill out a second factor verification page:

![Providus OTP]({{ "/img/collections/providus_final.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }})
