# Introduction

In this example we'll go through all of the steps and give examples on what you'll need to do to implement a call to pay out funds to customers. Once you've read through this guide you'll know everything that is required by us for you to use our payout system.

Let's assume you operate in the US, and would like to use our site to send funds to Nigerian bank accounts. You have a user registered and KYC'd  on your site called `Jane Doe`. She is a recurring user on your site, and her user ID in your system is `Sender:US:234523`. She creates a transaction on your site asking you to send `100 USD` to her partner in Nigeria `John Doe`. She is going to fund the transaction ins `USD`. Let's assume the transaction created in your system has an ID of `Transaction:NGN:17523`.

Once you have the details collected on your end, you can then initiate the transaction in our system. This example will guide you through the details you need to set and what calls you need to make. Since the easiest way to access our system is through our SDKs this guide is mainly aimed at users of our SDKs.

<div class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
**Warning!** We require that all implementations to our site pass our onboarding test before we allow users to access our production site. This example shows the preferred solution to all requirements we have, so following this example will make sure you will adhere to our requirements and will hopefully pass our onboarding test.
</div>

<div class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
**Note!** This guide assumes that you are doing a full KYC on your senders which we have approved. If not some of the steps can be slightly more complex than shown in this guide, most notably you'll need to create senders separately and wait for them to get approved before you can create transactions. Please check our [KYC guide]({{ "/docs/kyc/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}){: .alert-link} for more info.
</div>

# Authentication

First thing is that you'll need to authenticate to use our site. You can get your API key and secret by logging in to the [TransferZero developer portal](https://developers.transferzero.com).

<div class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
**Note!** You need to [contact us](mailto:info@transferzero.com){: .alert-link} before you are allowed to use our sandbox environment. Once you reach out to us you'll also be invited to our Slack channel where you can post questions about our API that will be answered by our Engineering team. We prefer technical communication to go through this Slack channel.
</div>

Once you obtain your api key and secret you'll need to set up your environment with them:

{% capture data-raw %}
See the [authentication documentation]({{ "/docs/authentication/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) for more details on the authentication process if you're not using our SDKs
{% endcapture %}

{% capture data-csharp %}
```csharp
Configuration configuration = new Configuration();
configuration.ApiKey = "<key>";
configuration.ApiSecret = "<secret>";
configuration.BasePath = "https://api-sandbox.transferzero.com/v1";
```
{% endcapture %}

{% capture data-vb %}
```vb
Dim configuration As Configuration = New Configuration()
configuration.ApiKey = "KEY"
configuration.ApiSecret = "SECRET"
configuration.BasePath = "https://api-sandbox.transferzero.com/v1"
```
{% endcapture %}

{% capture data-java %}
```java
ApiClient apiClient = new ApiClient();
apiClient.setApiKey("<key>");
apiClient.setApiSecret("<secret>");
apiClient.setBasePath("https://api-sandbox.transferzero.com/v1");
```
{% endcapture %}

{% capture data-js %}
```js
const apiClient = new ApiClient();
apiClient.apiKey = '<key>';
apiClient.apiSecret = '<secret>';
apiClient.basePath = 'https://api-sandbox.transferzero.com/v1';
```
{% endcapture %}

{% capture data-php %}
```php
TransferZero\Configuration::getDefaultConfiguration()
    ->setHost("https://api-sandbox.transferzero.com/v1")
    ->setApiKey("<key>")
    ->setApiSecret("<secret>");
```
{% endcapture %}

{% capture data-ruby %}
```ruby
TransferZero.configure do |config|
    config.api_key = '<key>'
    config.api_secret = '<secret>'
    config.host = 'https://api-sandbox.transferzero.com/v1'
end
```
{% endcapture %}

# Sender details

Next step is setting up the sender details. Generally you'll need to send us the following information for every sender:

* name
* country
* phone number
* address
* birth date
* email address

<div class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
**Note!** Dependent on your KYC processes you might be able opt in to use WTR2 rules for your senders in which case the requirements are slightly relaxed. Please contact us if this is of any interest to you!
</div>

You should also send us the ID you use in your local system to link to this sender, in this example `Sender:US:234523`. By doing so you'll be able to handle senders much easier in our system.

<div class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
**Warning!** Being able to re-use senders is one of our main requirements for successful onboarding. By linking the senders from your system to our system you can make sure you won't have issues fulfilling this dependency.

# Recipient details

Once you have the sender let's set up the recipient as well. In this example we're going to do an `NGN::Bank` payout, which requires a name and the bank account details. Other payout providers might have different requirements, to check them please see our [individual payments documentation]({{ "/docs/individual-payments/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}). You'll also need to send in how much you wish to send. In this example we're sending $100 worth of funds, that are going to be received in NGN - we'll calculate the proper amount based on the exchange rates.

# Tying all together

Finally we need to tie the sender and recipient together into a transaction. The are only two extra details required: the external ID of this transaction (how you refer to this transaction in your system), and the currency this transaction will be funded (the currency you held your balance with us).

<div class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
**Note!** While the external ID is generally optional, sending it can help tie transactions between our systems easier. Also you can use it to block duplicate transactions as we won't allow you to send in another transaction with the same external ID in the future.

# Creating and funding the transaction

Now that we have generated the objects, we'll need to call the endpoint. The easiest way is to use our `create_and_fund` endpoint which will both create the transaction and immediately deduct funds from your internal wallet to fund it.

<div class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
**Warning!** Using this endpoint means that you implicitly approve the exchange rate of the transaction. You can also opt in to create and fund the transactions separately, and double check the amounts inside the transaction after it has been created, and only fund it afterwards. Transactions will never initate payments before they are funded. There is also a `calculate` endpoint you can use to mock transaction creation and get the exchange rates used without creating the transaction itself.

<div class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
**Info!** Please note that as you can usually always expect validation errors calling any of our endpoints, so you should always check for errors when calling our APIs. A transaction which has validation errors is never created, you have to re-create it once the problems with the details have been fixed.
</div>

# Waiting for the transaction to finish

Once the transaction is created and funded it goes into our processing queue. During this processing we will constantly try to pay out the funds. Dependent on the payment corridor and the recipient this can take anything from couple of minutes (for example for NGN Bank payments) to a couple of days (for example for MAD cash pickup transactions). In order to let you know when the transaction has finished paying out we will send out a notification to your registered webhook address, to let you know that the transaction has finished processing.

To set up webhooks you can use the [TransferZero developer portal](https://developers.transferzero.com). We will always call the endpoint you set up here using `POST`, and the request will always contain the same authentication headers you'll need to use to call our APIs, so you can use them to validate that the request is coming from us.

You will need to handle three major webhook events namely `transaction.paid_out`, `transaction.refunded` and `recipient.error`. The first one will notify you if the transaction was succesfully paid out to the recipient. The second one will notify you if a transaction was cancelled and the funds have been returned to your balance. Finally the last one will notify you if there was a problem while trying to pay out the recipient.

If you don't do full KYC then you should also sign up for the `sender.approved` event which will notify you if a sender is approved and can start transacting, and the `sender.rejected` event which signals if there is a problem with the sender.

If the transaction was paid there is nothing more to do from our end, you can update the system on your end to let your customer know that the transaction has paid out. On cancellation you'll need to update your system to know that this transaction will not process further.

If there was an error you can find the error description in the `state_reason` field of the recipient. Note that this error is usually technical in nature hence we don't suggest to showing this to your customer verbatim. It can be shown to your customer support staff however.

<div class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
**Warning!** Due to how the markets we operate in work we will contantly retry to pay out transactions, so even after you receive a `recipient.error` error webhook we will still keep trying, until it has either paid out successfully (and you receive a `transaction.paid_out` event), or you explicitly cancel the transaction by calling the cancel recipient endpoint. We will also cancel transactions we could not pay out within the first 24 hours, in which case you'll receive a `transaction.refunded` webhook once the cancellation is processed, but you can opt out of this feature if you'd like to manage cancellation yourself.
</div>

You can read more about transaction errors in our [error handling documentation]({{ "/docs/error-handling/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}).

<div class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
**Note!** The `recipient.error` webhook only returns the recipient and not the full transaction details. You will receive the transaction id however and you'll be able to query that separately if you need the transaction details as well.
</div>

# Getting the transaction status manually

While we prefer that you primarily use the webhook facility to get notified about state changes, occasionally you might want to query a transaction's state in our system so you'll be able to update it on your end. You can either use the TransferZero Transaction ID for this, or the External Id we set up earlier. In this example we'll use the External ID

# Cancelling transactions

Finally as mentioned above sometimes payment processing can fail for various reasons. While we try as hard as possible to pay out the funds to the intended recipient, occasionally you wish to stop this process and get a refund.

<div class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
**Warning!** Unless the auto cancel feature is enabled for you we will never cancel funded transactions. You should make sure to only cancel and refund transactions on your end, once you have cancelled transactions inside TransferZero and got the refund confirmation through the webhook. We are constantly retrying transactions that are not cancelled in our system - even if the error message suggest that they are unlikely to pay out in the future (and we've seen that they could indeed pay out days later)
</div>

<div class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
**Note!** As shown below cancellations are done on the recipient object and not the transaction.
