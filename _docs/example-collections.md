# Introduction

In this example we'll go through all of the steps and give examples on what you'll need to do to implement a call to collect funds from  customers into your internal balance. Once you've read through this guide you'll know everything that is required by us for you to use our collection system.

Let's assume that you would like to obtain funds from one of your Ghanan customer, `Jane Doe`. You have already fully KYC'd her, as she is a recurring user on your site. Her user ID in your system is `Sender:GH:9547`. She creates an order in your system for which she is charged `50 GHS` that she'd like to pay using her mobile wallet. For this transaction let's assume the transaction created in your system has an ID of `Collection:GHS:91475`.

Once you have the details collected on your end, you can then initiate the transaction in our system. This example will guide you through the details you need to set and what calls you need to make. Since the easiest way to access our system is through our SDKs this guide is mainly aimed at users of our SDKs.

<div class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
**Warning!** We require that all implementations to our site pass our onboarding test before we allow users to access our prouction site. This example shows the preferred solution to all requirements we have, so following this example will make sure you will adhere to our requirements and will hopefully pass our onboarding test.
</div>

<div class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
**Note!** This guide assumes that you are doing a full KYC on your senders which we have approved. If not some of the steps can be slightly more complex than shown in this guide, most notably you'll need to create senders separately and wait for them to get approved before you can create transactions. Please check our [KYC guide]({{ "/docs/kyc/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}){: .alert-link} for more info.
</div>

# Authentication

First thing is that you'll need to authenticate to use our site. You can get your API key and secret by logging in to the [TransferZero developer portal](https://developers.transferzero.com).

<div class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
**Note!** You need to [contact us](mailto:info@transferzero.com){: .alert-link} before you are allowed to use our sandbox environment. Once you reach out to us you'll also be invited to our Slack channel where you can post questions about our API that will be answered by our Engineering team. We prefer technical communication to go through this Slack channel.
</div>

Once you obtain your api key and secret you'll need to set up your environment with them:

{% capture data-raw %}
See the [authentication documentation]({{ "/docs/authentication/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) for more details on the authentication process if you're not using our SDKs
{% endcapture %}

{% capture data-csharp %}
```csharp
Configuration configuration = new Configuration();
configuration.ApiKey = "<key>";
configuration.ApiSecret = "<secret>";
configuration.BasePath = "https://api-sandbox.transferzero.com/v1";
```
{% endcapture %}

{% capture data-vb %}
```vb
Dim configuration As Configuration = New Configuration()
configuration.ApiKey = "KEY"
configuration.ApiSecret = "SECRET"
configuration.BasePath = "https://api-sandbox.transferzero.com/v1"
```
{% endcapture %}

{% capture data-java %}
```java
ApiClient apiClient = new ApiClient();
apiClient.setApiKey("<key>");
apiClient.setApiSecret("<secret>");
apiClient.setBasePath("https://api-sandbox.transferzero.com/v1");
```
{% endcapture %}

{% capture data-js %}
```js
const apiClient = new ApiClient();
apiClient.apiKey = '<key>';
apiClient.apiSecret = '<secret>';
apiClient.basePath = 'https://api-sandbox.transferzero.com/v1';
```
{% endcapture %}

{% capture data-php %}
```php
TransferZero\Configuration::getDefaultConfiguration()
    ->setHost("https://api-sandbox.transferzero.com/v1")
    ->setApiKey("<key>")
    ->setApiSecret("<secret>");
```
{% endcapture %}

{% capture data-ruby %}
```ruby
TransferZero.configure do |config|
    config.api_key = '<key>'
    config.api_secret = '<secret>'
    config.host = 'https://api-sandbox.transferzero.com/v1'
end
```
{% endcapture %}

# Sender details

Next step is setting up the sender details. Generally you'll need to send us the following information for every sender:

* name
* country
* phone number
* address
* birth date
* email address

<div class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
**Note!** Dependent on your KYC processes you might be able opt in to use WTR2 rules for your senders in which case the requirements are slightly relaxed. Please contact us if this is of any interest to you!
</div>

You should also send us the ID you use in your local system to link to this sender, in this example `Sender:GH:9547`. By doing so you'll be able to handle senders much easier in our system.

<div class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
**Warning!** Being able to re-use senders is one of our main requirements for successful onboarding. By linking the senders from your system to our system you can make sure you won't have issues fulfilling this dependency.

# Recipient details

Once you have the sender let's set up the recipient as well. For collections you usually collect the funds in your internal wallet. Let's assume you wish to collect the funds in `USD` (we'll calculate the exchange rate).

# Collection details

Finally we need to tie the sender and recipient together into a transaction. We also need to set up the collection settings as well. Since we're going to use GHS mobile collection, we'll have to provide the sender's phone number.

<div class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
**Note!** While the external ID is generally optional for transactions, sending it can help tie transactions between our systems easier. Also you can use it to block duplicate transactions as we won't allow you to send in another transaction with the same external ID in the future.

**Note!** For some other collections provider you'll need to tell the customer some extra details, like a reference number, or redirect them to a URL we send back in the response to finish the collection.

<div class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
**Info!** Please note that as you can usually always expect validation errors calling any of our endpoints, so you should always check for errors when calling our APIs. A transaction which has validation errors is never created, you have to re-create it once the problems with the details have been fixed.
</div>

# Waiting for the transaction to finish

Once the transaction is created, the customer has one hour to fulfill the collection requirements. After this initial period has elapsed the transaction will be cancelled and it will not accept funds received anymore. In order to let you know when the customer has fulfilled the collection and paid in the funds we will send out a notification to your registered webhook address.

To set up webhooks you can use the [TransferZero developer portal](https://developers.transferzero.com). We will always call the endpoint you set up here using `POST`, and the request will always contain the same authentication headers you'll need to use to call our APIs, so you can use them to validate that the request is coming from us.

{% capture data-raw %}
See the [webhooks documentation]({{ "/docs/architecture/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}#webhooks) for more details on what you can expect to receive on the endpoint you register with us.

Once setting up an endpoint where you'll be receiving callbacks you can use the following code snippet to both verify that the webhook we sent out is legitimate, and then parse it's contents regardless of type.

The details you need to provide Is
- the body of the webhook/callback you received as a string
- the url of your webhook, where you are awaiting the callbacks - this has to be the full URL
- the authentication headers you have received on your webhook endpoint - as a dictionary

For collections you will need to handle three major webhook events namely `transaction.paid_in`, `transaction.paid_out` and `transaction.canceled`. The first one will notify you if the customer has paid in the funds. The second one will notify you if the funds were then put into your internal balance (which usually happens right after the funds have been received). Finally the last event lets you know that we haven't received the funds in time.

If you don't do full KYC then you should also sign up for the `sender.approved` event which will notify you if a sender is approved and can start transacting, and the `sender.rejected` event which signals if there is a problem with the sender.

<div class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
**Warning!** For some collection providers the user can accidentally send different amount that is required from them. In this case you will receive a `transaction.mispaid` event, and the transaction will change to reflect how much was actually received. You should always double check the transaction status to know how much has been actually paid in.
</div>

<div class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
**Note!** In case the customer has not paid in the funds in the allotted time, you'll need to create a new transaction.
</div>

# Getting the transaction status manually

While we prefer that you primarily use the webhook facility to get notified about state changes, occasionally you might want to query a transaction's state in our system so you'll be able to update it on your end. You can either use the TransferZero Transaction ID for this, or the External Id we set up earlier. In this example we'll use the External ID
